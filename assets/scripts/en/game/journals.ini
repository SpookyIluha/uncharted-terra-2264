entry = "Atmospheric entry began nominally. The planetary electromagnetic field was detected well in advance - mapped, modeled, accounted for. The ship's systems were supposedly hardened for it. Whatever this is, it wasn't in the projections. Field intensity fluctuated without pattern. Navigation desynced, control surfaces lagged, then went non-responsive. I wasn't flying anymore - I was falling. Crash landing was uncontrolled but survivable. Hull integrity compromised, primary drive offline. Power reserves critically low. Even if I could stabilize the ship, lifting out of this gravity well would require an energy source far beyond what I have on board. The colony is close. Abandoned, by the look of it. For now, the ship stays grounded. Repairs could use whatever's inside the colony."

entry = "Another day, another headache. This gate is a disaster waiting to happen. The human access panel won't respond without the resonant installed - keeps being silent in the wind. And the Irenix insisted we leave it in so the door 'recognizes the settlement's voice'. Or whatever. Dropped my ID badge over the edge - perfect. I had to haul myself onto that damn cliff again because the console's housing wouldn't stay stable. No idea how I'm supposed to get back inside without some fishing gear."

entry = "What they call 'power crystals' aren't really fuel rods - they're resonant conduits.\n\n The Irenix carve and tune them so that ambient field energy flows through like water through a valve. No combustion, no depletion. Even the small ones sure serve as keys or stabilizers.\n If even a fraction of their notes are true, then whatever's down there must be true and is something special..."

timestamp = "15/09/2193 ET"
entry =  "I've treated Irenix patients for nearly three cycles now, and I still feel like I'm guessing half the time. I know their language, but not meaning. They don't feel 'pain' like we do. Fear looks like curiosity. Gratitude looks like... nothing at all.\n\n They insist they understand us. I don't doubt that they do - logically and anatomically. What worries me is that understanding doesn't seem to change their intent. When a human understands pain, they try to avoid it. When an Irenix understands pain, they simply acknowledge it.\n\nAdministration asked me to sign them on the new experimental 'rhetoric crystal treatments'. Seems like these crystals do have a major impact on their behavior. I did. I told myself it was no different from prescribing stronger 'human' medication. Still, something about how eagerly they agree to those treatments unsettled me.\n\nI moved one of the spare resonants out of circulation. I'm not really a protestor or denying them treatment, I just want to figure out the best approach. I told myself it was a precaution. If someone needs it urgently, they'll know where I work.\n\nSame storage room near the entrance. Same door I open at the start of every shift in case anyone needs an emergency after a walk outside.\n\nOh and its also the middle of the month, time to change passwords... Let's see... How about the number of Irenix's glowing luminaxes on their body times a thoushand?"

name = "Coorta's night shift"
timestamp = "11/10/2193 ET"
entry = "People laugh at the watchman, but they don't work nights like I do. They don't hear the place when it's empty - when the hum of the walls gets louder because there's nothing else to drown it out.\n\nHe told me once that the lights calm him. Says patterns matter more than brightness. I joked that if patterns were important, he could understand the aliens by just looking at them.\n\nBut that's not entirely true, is it? Every time I walk Corridor C, I count them. I don't know when I started. He's to blame for it for all I know. Same number, every night. Same order. Helps me remember where I am when the corridors blur together.\n\nMaybe the watchman isn't crazy. But he sure isn't that bright. Kind of saw him keeping his cabinet's password the same as the current year. \n\n Also the bridge broke last night, wonder how?"

timestamp = "21/10/2193 ET"
entry = "After that happened I am still breathing. Means I'm quiet enough.\n\nThey pass the corridor sometimes 1 by 1, rarer now. I hear them before I see the lights change. When the hum drops, I stop moving. When it rises, I don't think - I just wait.\n\nI don't know how many are left like me. People, I mean. They don't walk. I can't hear them walking, now more like running. Oh they sure know everything! Poor souls.\n\nI broke the lift. I had time - just enough. Took the coupling apart and hid the piece and reset the keypad. My hands are shaking 2 bad can't even hold the piece of it in my hands. They can't come out, they can't.\n\nI keep counting things. The door. The lights. Steps between walls. Numbers don't lie. See the numbers! They can't take numbers unless I give them away. From my point of view its left, left, right, and there I left it, for 3.\n\nIf you found this, you're alive. That means you still have choices."

entry = "Life here is quieter than I expected, kind of contained in a way. The walls hum softly at night, and sometimes the air feels humid, like after a good rain.\n\nThe aliens keep mostly to themselves, but they're not unfriendly. My daughter loves them, as their 6 markings glow faintly when they talk among themselves. The kids say it means they're thinking. I don't know if that's true, but I like the idea.\n\nThere's a rhythm to the colony with a schedule for work cycles and meal times. There are energy surges that dim the lights for a heartbeat and then pass, but they happen like once a month. Nothing to worry about.\n\nThe director says this colony is a humanity's Reach. And everyore has a different opinion about it, most just keep it to themselves. But they can't argue that this is the only place to mine those crystals for outworlds. And also the research center on them at the same time.\n\nOff I go, I'll be seeing you for real next cycle. Just you wait! Bye!"

timestamp = "10/10/2193 ET"
entry = "Structural systems remain intact, but the actuator locks whenever the lower grid cycles. Mechanical diagnostics show no faults - which is somehow worse.\n\nResonance readings spike in pulses just as usual. The Irenix engineers call it synchronization feedback. They say it means the system is 'learning.'\n\nI don't like that word when applied to infrastructure.\n\nStanding on the bridge during a spike feels wrong. Like the metal is holding its breath. I've started scheduling repairs to avoid overlap with deep system tests.\n\nRequested cog replacement approved and installation deferred until after final calibration.\n\nP.S. ...Everything seems to be waiting for that. In the meantime people can go through Sector C and Test Labs.\n\nAlso has anyone seen the lever off of this jack?"

entry = "Aw man. Command ordered additional patrols near the elevator shaft today. 'Officially' it's about safety - unstable power, yada yada, unfinished construction.\n\nUnofficially, something feels very wrong about this. Tried to shut up that crazy watchman, he doesn't help the situation. Also what's up with the sparkies?\n\nThe Irenix have stopped using the common corridors. When they do appear, it's always in a group, always silent and always down that damn elevator. And even if they talk, they always choose words that wouldn't translate well.\n\nFeels like this colony has been on an alert for quite some time now. My hunting past remind me of prey that's heard something move in the dark and hasn't decided whether to run."

entry = "how did I even manage to hear this??? I was walking near the chief's cabin when the voices got louder\n\nhe asked if the 'integration was truly safe'. If the 'system would preserve individuality' his words!!! not mine!\n\nan then there was a looooong pause before answering. The translator barely managed to get it though the wall as I wasn't really keen on alien exotic speaking.\n\nand of course it chose a word that didn't feel right. 'Completion'???? Are those 'wavy' aliens always this crypic?? they're lame as hell..\n\nNo one spoke after that though. At least I didnt hear anymore of it \n\n!!!and then I remembered that it was probably something not supposed to happen and I slipped away. technically not spying, just overheard! :)"
