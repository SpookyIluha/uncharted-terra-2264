When the final control is disengaged, there is no explosion, no dramatic collapse - only a deep, settling quiet, as if something vast has finally exhaled. The hum that filled the cavern fades first, then the vibration beneath your feet, until the stone feels like stone again.

Lights across the control room dim one by one. The pods surrounding the machine fall still, their internal glow extinguished, leaving behind empty shells shaped for bodies that will never return. Somewhere above, systems shut down in sequence.

The planetary field weakens.

You feel it before you see it - a pressure lifting from your chest, a static weight peeling away from the air. On your way back through the colony, doors remain open, but they no longer respond. The place is truly dead now. Not abandoned, not waiting - finished.

Your ship takes longer to repair than you expected, but the colony provides what it once hoarded. Power cells, structural plating, and a handful of intact crystals, still humming faintly, inert without the machine that once guided them.

When you lift off, the planet does not react.

The field dissipates into nothing, leaving the sky wide and unguarded. The moons drift on, unaware. From orbit, the colony is barely visible, swallowed by rock and dust, its walls meaningless without purpose.

You leave with a story no one will fully believe.
