There is a remote exoplanet colony that was jointly inhabited by humans and an alien species known only by fragments of their designation: The Irenix.

The colony was abandoned generations ago after a cataclysmic failure of a shared project - an energy-manipulating device deep inside the settlement.

Rumors suggest that restoring this device could reveal what happened to the colony’s inhabitants and discover a limitless power source, but the site is considered too unstable to explore.

No one outside of the colony really knows what the artifact really was, or how it failed, or what happened to the colonists. 

There were attempts at exploration beforehand, but no one came back. 



That does not stop you anyway.
