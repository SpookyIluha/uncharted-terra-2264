Additionally you can crouch with the Z button and sprint with the L/R buttons
Pressing start opens the pause menu which has your collected items on the left,
options in the middle and the collected journals on the right.

Also you can try combining 2 items into one, by first selecting the first item (press A), then hovering on the second item and press B to combine them
If the 2 items can be combined, a new item will appear in the place of previous ones.

In the journals section you can navigate through your journals (scrolling if necessary)
To read a journal, press A on it
When reading a journal you can use D-Pad or C-Pad to scroll up or down the journal.

Now that you're inside the colony, you need to get to the deeper level of it, there's a lift in the Corridor B that needs to be repaired and powered on
corridor B is at the left of the main hub area

Inside (Corridor A)

- go through to the main hub

Main hub

- at the end of the hallway is the lift that is broken and powered off, across it there's a power holder and a conduit holder, 
you'll need a conduit and a crystal for it to be repaired
- there's also a watchman's office to the right with a keypad
- near the entrance to the corridor B there's another journal if you need it

- inside there's a crystal, watchman's journal and a conduit rod, grab all of them
- read the watchman's journal, it says that he hid the conduit wiring somewhere and he deliberately broke the bridge
- in the journal you can readd about "seeing the numbers" and a path to where he hid the wiring (left, left, right and there I left it) which is the cabin
- the numbers in the journal go like this: 1 1 2 3, this is the passkey to the cabin
- go back from the office, use the crystal on the second panel at the end of the hallway
- go back to the main hub, then to the bridge area, then to the corridor c

Corridor c

- inside the cabin, there's conduit wiring and a journal in the opposite corner, grab them
- combine theee conduit wiring with the conduit rod to get a conduit
- go back to the corridor B through the bridge and the main hub

Corridor B
- use the conduit on the first panel at the end of the hallway
- that'll open up the lift across and you can go into it to the deeper level

Deeper level
- in the middle of the hallway to the left, there's an energy bridge blocked by 5 lazer grids
- to the left there's a security room that control them
- to the right you can find a couple dead bodies, journals and a crystal, grab it
- go to the security room
- in the security room there are 5 holders for the crystal, each toggles the lazers to the left and to the right of it
- i.e using a crystal on the second holder will toggle the first and third lazer and so on.
- there are 5 lazer grids and the last one is disabled
- use the crystal on the last holder, then grab it back by pressing a
- go to the first holder and use a crystal on it, that'll turn off the second lazer
- then grab it back and use it on the second holder, that'll turn off the first and the third lazer

- choose the option that suits you (provided that you've read the lore) and after pressing the A button on the option, you can bo back through the bridge back into the elevator

That'll trigger a cutscene and that's it, enjoy your ending
