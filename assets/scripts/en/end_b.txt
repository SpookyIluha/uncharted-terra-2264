The terminal accepted your command.

For a moment, nothing happened - then the machine surged, its resonance snapped into a higher pitch, sharp enough to rattle your teeth. The pods flared to life, crystal light spilling across the chamber in violent waves.

As you stepped forward, the air thickened, heavy and charged, like standing inside a held breath.

The doors unlock. Then you hear and see them.

What you saw was not an army - but a mass of bodies moving as one, reshaped by crystal and will, their forms twisted into something no longer individual, no longer alive in a way anyone would understand.

They did not hesitate.

The machine did not grant control. It announced you.

They surged forward, overwhelming, consuming, erased you as they erased the colony, the crew, the explorers who came after, all of them drawn by the same promise of an infinite energy source.

There is no voice left to scream.

The machine continues to hum.

The field remains active.

And sometime after, another adventurer - another ship drawn in by the old tales.
