entry = "Atmospheric entry began nominally. The planetary electromagnetic field was detected well in advance - mapped, modeled, accounted for. The ship's systems were supposedly hardened for it. Whatever this is, it wasn't in the projections. Field intensity fluctuated without pattern. Navigation desynced, control surfaces lagged, then went non-responsive. I wasn't flying anymore - I was falling. Crash landing was uncontrolled but survivable. Hull integrity compromised, primary drive offline. Power reserves critically low. Even if I could stabilize the ship, lifting out of this gravity well would require an energy source far beyond what I have on board. The colony is close. Abandoned, by the look of it. For now, the ship stays grounded. Repairs could use whatever's inside the colony."

entry = "Another day, another headache. This gate is a disaster waiting to happen. The human access panel won't respond without the resonant installed - keeps being silent in the wind. And the Irenix insisted we leave it in so the door 'recognizes the settlement's voice'. Or whatever. Dropped my ID badge over the edge - perfect. I had to haul myself onto that damn cliff again because the panel's housing wouldn't stay stable. No idea how I'm supposed to get back inside without some fishing gear."

entry = "What they call 'power crystals' aren't really fuel rods - they're resonant conduits.\n\n The Irenix carve and tune them so that ambient field energy flows through like water through a valve. No combustion, no depletion. Even the small ones sure serve as keys or stabilizers.\n If even a fraction of their notes are true, then whatever's down there must be true and is something special..."
